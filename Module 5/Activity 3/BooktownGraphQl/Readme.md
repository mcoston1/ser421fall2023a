Alrighty. Activity #3. 


Full disclosure - I don't know if this works. 

I tried my hardest to copy over the same 'kind' of code from the example repo, but I'm not sure how that went. 

While I appreciate Prof Gary doing a walkthrough on the JPA example - it was a bit late considering the assignment is due tonight. And to be entirely honest - I still didn't understand what the heck he was talking about. 

There was no discussion about actually building a database style example. Just the walkthrough and then the examples. 

I think I got it right, but I don't have the energy to test it. Up at 4am today - screen is blurry at this point.
