SER 421 Rest Lab

Important Notes:
 - Names for users, questions for survey items, states for getting surveys in a particular state - all of these methods are case insensitive and maintained in the memory as such. Kevin is kevin is kEvIN is KevIN for a user. 

 - Most of the error handling is pretty generic, but I tried to make it informative enough for someone to get the gist of what is going wrong.
